cd COMP3022_Project


To run experiments, you need to download the datasets first. You can find the download instructions below.

After downloading and preparing all data, you can run experiments by running shell scripts in /experiment.

All algorithm implementations can be found in /algorithms/cpp_files.

Compiled executable can be found in /algorithms/executable.



Download and Prepare Data:

The experiment used two datasets.

NCVoter can be found at https://dl.ncsbe.gov/index.html?prefix=data/.

IP combines two datasets, they can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/global-ip-dataset-by-location-2023 and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsrojas/ip-network-traffic-flows-labeled-with-87-apps.

All data are processed before use.

For NCVoters, you can run

NCVoter_download.py  // if there's any error with this, use a VPN and run again
NCVoter_unzip.py
NCVoter_process.py
NCVoter_chunk.py

in the given order, to reproduce the required data.


For IPs, 

1. download zip from both kaggle sites, and unzip them
2. get all five csv files and put them under /dataset/download/IPs
3. run IP_process.py and IP_chunk.py


After that, all processed data can be found at /dataset/cleaned. And you are ready to run experiments.
