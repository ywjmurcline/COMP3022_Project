# COMP3022_Project
COMP3022 individual project on cardinality estimation.

This project aims to reproduce some of the classic cardinality estimation algorithms, and design experiments to evaluate their time consumption and memory comsumption.

Run experiment by:
```
```
g++ -std=c++11 -O2 hyperloglog.cpp hash/murmurhash.cpp -o hyperloglog
